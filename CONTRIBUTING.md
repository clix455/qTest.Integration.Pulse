Contributing
----------------------------------

1. File an issue to notify the community about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs and comments.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

File an Issue
----------------------------------

Use the issue tracker to start the discussion. It is possible that someone 
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or 
that the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue 
tracker  will be used to hash that all out.

Style Guides
-------------------
1. Write in UTF-8 in node.js 12.15.0 LTS
2. Use modular architecture to group similar functions, classes, etc.
3. Always use 4 spaces for indentation (don't use tabs)
4. Variable names should always be camelCase (WIP to standardize)
5. Function names should always be camelCase
6. Look at the existing style and adhere accordingly
7. Do not attempt to utilize any further node.js libs without an FCR to add 
   them to the Pulse environment

Fork the Repository
-------------------

No standards at the moment.

Send the Pull Request
---------------------

Once you have made all your changes and updated the documentation, make a pull 
request to move everything back into the main branch of the `repository`. Be 
sure to reference the original issue in the pull request. Expect some back-and-forth 
with regards to style and compliance of these rules.
